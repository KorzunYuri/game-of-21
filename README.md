# Game of 21  
Yet another simple logical game

Last weekend I spent some time in my parental home sorting out my old things left from school days, 
and I found some notes of a simple game that I had been playing with my friends for a while. 
By my 30 I have become neither a game developer nor just a developer (althoug, I hope, this will change),
so let this project be a little step to my dream and a tribute to my childhood.
